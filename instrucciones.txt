Load testing is a critical component in building reliable systems.  This lab walks you through using a load test framework, Locust, to test a Flask Microservice. Let's get started.  

Note: We recommend that you open this notebook in the most updated version Google Chrome for the most consistent experience.

Run Flask and test it out

Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.

cd into the projects directory:  cd /home/coder/project

install virtualenv:  python3 -m pip install virtualenv

create a virtualenv: /home/coder/.local/bin/virtualenv VENV

source the virtualenv (activate it):  source VENV/bin/activate

cd into flask project:  cd /home/coder/project/docker-flask-locust

install software:  make install

run flask:  python app.py

Now open up browser preview and test out the Microservice, by typing in the following:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Load Test

Open second terminal in Visual Studio Code.

cd into the projects directory:  cd /home/coder/project

source the virtualenv (activate it):  source VENV/bin/activate

cd into flask project:  cd /home/coder/project/docker-flask-locust

Start the locust load test by running the following command:  locust -H 127.0.0.1 -f locustfile.py 

Open up the Browser Preview and navigate to localhost:8089 and fill out the following fields as shown in the screenshot: Number of total users:  2, Spawn rate: 2, Host: http://127.0.0.1:8080

Select 'Start swarming' to start the load test.
